# f22_translator_flask_heroku_tutorial
Flask app deployed on Heroku with some documentation


First, visit this link to try out the app! 
https://f22-translator.herokuapp.com/

Once you've done that, take a look at the structure of this project!
The file structure should look something similar to this:
.
├── Procfile
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── static
│   ├── main.js
│   └── style.css
├── templates
│   └── index.html
└── trans.py

First, note the Procfile: this is used by Heroku to automatically build our website once it is deployed from Github to their platform. Please don't touch it! It's perfectly fine the way it is.
